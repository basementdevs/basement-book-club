## Topics 📝

### Others 🗣️

- **International career**
How to prepare to work in another country, including migration or remote work. Each option has its own burden and bonus.

- **Living in other country**
The quality of life of living outside Brazil, where a huge difference is in security. The choice between continuing to live in Brazil or living in another country involves whether or not you are close to your family, which is a sensitive point for many people.

- **Current learning and work**
About what we are currently studying or working on. In technology, studying is essential to building a healthy career considering that things change very quickly and we must always be ready for opportunities.
